## Overview
This section of MSIX Labs is focussed on App Attach.
MSIX App Attach is a way to deliver MSIX applications to both physical and virtual machines. However, MSIX App Attach is different from regular MSIX because it's made especially for supported products, such as Azure Virtual Desktop.

App Attach provides Enterprises the following advantages:
1. Easier Windows Image management.
2. Better app manageability including lower maintenance costs and better security.

Streamed app's data roams with the user. This helps them instantly run apps and continue their experience wherever they are.

The MSIX app needs to be converted to a App Attach ready format and then deployed to Azure Virtual Desktop. 
AppAttachExtension automates the steps involved in this conversion and deployment process, enabling you to get started with App Attach much faster!
